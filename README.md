This project is an **Automated Timetable Generator** developed during a hackathon. It is designed to automate the process of creating timetables for educational institutions, organizations, or personal use. The tool uses Python to generate timetables efficiently and avoids scheduling conflicts.


## Features

- **Automated Timetable Generation**: Generates timetables based on input constraints.
- **Conflict-Free Scheduling**: Ensures no overlapping schedules for resources (teachers, rooms, etc.).
- **Customizable Inputs**: Allows users to define subjects, teachers, rooms, and time slots.
- **Export Options**: Exports the generated timetable in a user-friendly format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for quick setup and execution.

## How It Works

The script uses a combination of algorithms to allocate subjects, teachers, and rooms to available time slots while avoiding conflicts. It takes inputs such as:
- List of subjects
- List of teachers
- List of rooms
- Time slots
- Constraints (e.g., teacher availability, room capacity)

Based on these inputs, the script generates a timetable that satisfies all constraints.
