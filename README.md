# Automated Timetable Generator

This project is an **Automated Timetable Generator** developed during **wHACKiest 2024**, a hackathon held at **Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT)** on **December 18, 2024**. The tool is designed to automate the process of creating timetables for educational institutions, organizations, or personal use. It uses Python to generate timetables efficiently and avoids scheduling conflicts.

---

## Features

- **Automated Timetable Generation**: Generates timetables based on input constraints.
- **Conflict-Free Scheduling**: Ensures no overlapping schedules for resources (teachers, rooms, etc.).
- **Customizable Inputs**: Allows users to define subjects, teachers, rooms, and time slots.
- **Export Options**: Exports the generated timetable in a user-friendly format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for quick setup and execution.

---

## How It Works

The script uses a combination of algorithms to allocate subjects, teachers, and rooms to available time slots while avoiding conflicts. It takes inputs such as:
- List of subjects
- List of teachers
- List of rooms
- Time slots
- Constraints (e.g., teacher availability, room capacity)

Based on these inputs, the script generates a timetable that satisfies all constraints.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishu-2004/automated_tt_generator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd automated_tt_generator
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Update the input files (e.g., `subjects.csv`, `teachers.csv`, `rooms.csv`) with your data.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python TT_Automated.py
   ```
3. The generated timetable will be saved in the `output` folder.

## Hackathon Details

This project was developed as part of **wHACKiest 2024**, a hackathon held at **M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT)** on **December 18, 2024**. The event started at **10:00 AM** and took place at the **ESB Seminar Hall 1**.

The goal of this project was to create a tool that simplifies the process of timetable generation, which is often a tedious and error-prone task. It was an exciting challenge to solve this problem within the hackathon's time constraints!
